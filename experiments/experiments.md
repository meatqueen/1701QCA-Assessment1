This experiment measured the current (voltage?) generated by the torque of the motor attached to a fan when it was blown on. This experiment introduced using Javascript instead of blocks to code. My focus was to understand the stucture of the code and what it means. 

For example, I interpret that:
if (value > Highest) {
        Highest = value  
means anytime variable ‘value’ is higher than value ‘highest’, rewrite ‘highest' to 'value'.

I am concious that most people who program microbits for niche purposes would not use blocks, and it'll be useful to be able to read and adapt relevant sections of online guides. I have some experience using R and I learned that unlike R, new variables are created by assigning them a value (in this case 0). I was reminded that code is case sensitive.

I don't understand the bracket syntax of Java, ie: basic.forever(function () {....}). The brackets after function, not sure that they are for, and I'm not sure what {    } brackets signify. I don't feel it is relevant to know 'whys' right now. "Scopes" and "methods" seems techincal and important, just not for me.

I learned the importance of good connections after a poor connection left me searching for faults elsehwere for 20 minutes. The breadboard wires tend to get poor connections when they are pulled out, so it's important to push them down in the sockets.

I recorded a highest value of 381. 

The real world applications of the "wind power" are obvious. However there are also other potental uses, such as use of other torque generating attachments to the fan ie: wheels. In relation to the projects we will make, this might be a kind of wind up toy that is activated by rolling it on the ground with some kind of electronic output. I imagine it would be difficult to store enough power to meaningfully power other functions of a toy like that, and maybe the winding up would be more of a trigger than a power supply, an illusion. 

### Tutorial 8: Compass Game ###

This experiment involved calibrating and using the compass on the microbit to play a sort of metal detecting game with LED flashing corresponding to the proximity of the player's angle with the random goal. So skills include: creating LED images in Javascript, generating random values, calibration of compass, using maths to program intervals of LED on state. 

Once again I was learning how to interpret Javascript. I see that all that controls the LED is the pause function, set to change after (distance from goal) x  5. It is a simple sequence that is alternated between on and off, and all that changes is the time of the pause. I see that the victory has a margin of error of 15 degrees:
if (difference < 15) {
        basic.showString("Winner!")...
And I also found that the code in the bood is either wrong or outdated, as Math.random(360) should be Math.randomRange(0,360). 
Calibrating the compass is something the microbit already knows how to do (with what I thought was a minigame), but the feedback of success of a :) message was not included and necessary to implement through code. 

This experiment used a lot of new and useful skills with further applications. The compass can be used as a reference point for say a mobile robot to be able to position itself. If multiple of such robots were used they could coordinate movements even from random orientations. Robots could return to original orientations after being interacted with. A rudimentary Roomba could work this way. 
The random command is very easy to use and could be very important especially for game purposes. Variety can extend the longevity of the game. It can also play a role in making a robot organic. Somewhat random elements (visual, motion, audio) create an illusion of not-machine.

This experiment initiates a sequence of LEDs after a button is pressed and then returns to a default, imitating a pedestrain crossing. 

I made mistakes assembling this experiment at first, not correctly alligning the resistors and the LEDs, and incorrectly ordering LEDs, just some careless assembly. I knew to be careful in the more busy tutorial 12. This experiment especially pulls me away from my tenfency of wanting to do logic over just basic functions. Otherwise this is experiment is not very ellaborate or challengeing. I also learned that the difference between a digital pin and an analog pin is just different values to represent power (0 to 1 for digital, 0 to 1025 for analog), however also that some components do not work with digital pins. 

I will undoubtedly chain multiple actions into a sequence in response to a stimulus. This ability is applicable in any microbit project, or any appliance. 

### Tutorial 12: Die ###

In this experiment the microbit is shaken to generate a random number from 0 to 5 that corresponds with a die face of 1 to 6 visualised by LEDs arranged like a die. It uses logic if ( ) then ( ), else ( ) more than any other tutorial so far. 

I correctly assembled this experiment on the first try, which was fortunate as it is quite busy and difficult. The die is working correctly in the video, but there was a mistake in the code which I later cleared up in a tutorial. I was confused about why in the instructions 'Item' was defined to be a random number between 0 to 5, and then divided by 1, rather than it being 1-6. This was actually an addition symbol in the instructions, and a classmate told me that it is standard to start the range at 0 and then adjust. For this reason my die did not roll the number 6 and it also sometimes did not work because the random number was 0, it did not correspond to anything. This would be easily adjusted without the addition sign just with logic, if 'Item' = 0 digitalwritepin.P0 to 1 (this LED is in the middle), and adding one is a personal choice. 

It is notable that the symmetry of the die is important to using only 4 pins instead of 6. Only later did I realise that the LED colour corresponds to the pin being activated. You would never need to control the diagonally opposite LEDs when imitating a die. 

I also changed the original code of 'On Button A press' that rolls the die to be 'Shake'. This seemed intuitive and you could say it is a microinteraction that links unrelated digital process with a physical action, if I used the language of ___AUTHOR_____. 

Using random numbers in combination with logic creates potential for a lot of outputs without a lot of inputs (in this case just a shake). Just like the compass game, it extends how long a user can find something novel. For example, everytime an animal toy is shaken it could produce a random sound from sound 1,2 or 3 and when it is pet it could produce the sounds 4 or 5, for no other reason than to create the variety expected from a living thing.
