It was difficult to find information online relevant to my project in some ways because it is the hard way of doing something quite basic. Using this particular kind of 'sensor' where an object closes a circuit without the use of any other sensors seems unconventional. The tracking of movement appears to be mostly done with infra-red sensors, but could also be done with a pressure sensor, a light sensor, an ultasonic distance sensor, and others I'm sure.

## Reading reflections ##

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

What I thought before: I'd previously felt that those sinks with the push down drain button were quite intuitive but I realise this is a learned behaviour. I've had experience with those sinks since I was a child, and the reading made the case that it really wasn't good design at all. It really is counterintuitive to dirty your hands to empty a sink. This must show how important it is to see past your own preconceptions about what is and isn't obvious. 

What I learned: This text was very informative. As with all things design I guess everyone has some intuitive knowledge of these things, but giving them terms like affordance and signifier and feedback demonstrates how things are made the way they are deliberately even when we don't feel it. I'd never considered that affordances and signifiers can disagree. This seems very important. A device that doesn't work in the way the user really thinks it would is so frustrating. I was aware that light switch arrangement should spatially match the lights in the room, but I'd also never considered that mapping and conceptualisation is a means of coping with the abstraction of electronics. Or that the design of an object can actively steer you away from some action (anti-affordance). 

What I would like to know more about: It would be interesting to know how certain accepted conceptualisations came about. Some, as the text acknowledges, are natural. But others weren't intuitive at some point and now are, especially the conventions of webdesign and OS's and such. 

The basic design principles outlined in this reading are integral to any project. I need to keep in mind what affordances my project has, and which ones it suggests with signifiers; what do I want people to do and what will people inevitably try to do, how I will feedback when they're doing it right and wrong. 

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

What I thought before: Many of the things I would've called features are called microinteractions here, like converting currencies or units of measurement. For things that I accepted as microinteractions, I didn't recognise their importance, "your product is as good as the smallest part" is the claim made by the text


What I learned: I never considered that microinteractions are the "feel" of the product and it makes total sense. When I think about the products I most love among many (competative market) it really is the details. 

*What I would like to know more about: Describe or write a question about something that you would be interested in knowing more about.*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: Describe the connection between the ideas in the reading and one of your current projects or how ideas in the reading could be used to improve your project.*

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

*What I thought before: Describe something that you thought or believed before you read the source that was challenged by the reading.*

What I learned: The reading demonstrated to me how someone with limited experience of programming and electronics could patchwork together a working prototype of quite an intelligent tool.

## Process documentation

*In this section, include text and images that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.*

*This should have quite a lot of information!*

*There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. Use the code below to include images, and copy it for each image, updating the information for each.*

*Include screenshots of the code you have used.*

## Project outcome ##

### Timing Gates Improved ###

### Project description ###

The timing gate track measures the velocity of a small object passing through two gates on the track, such as a toy car. It can be used to demonstrate concepts of physics. It can also be used to compare the speeds of different toy cars. On a larger scale, it could become a competative game. I

### Showcase image ###

*Try to capture the image as if it were in a portfolio, sales material, or project proposal. The project isn't likely to be something that finished, but practice making images that capture the project in that style.*

### Additional view ###

*Provide some other image that gives a viewer a different perspective on the project such as more about how it functions, the project in use, or something else.*
