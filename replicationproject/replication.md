It was difficult to find information online relevant to my project in some ways because it is the hard way of doing something quite basic. Using this particular kind of 'sensor' where an object closes a circuit without the use of any other sensors seems unconventional. The tracking of movement appears to be mostly done with infra-red sensors, but could also be done with a pressure sensor, a light sensor, an ultasonic distance sensor, and others I'm sure.

## Reading reflections ##

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

*What I thought before:* I'd previously felt that those sinks with the push down drain button were quite intuitive but I realise this is a learned behaviour. I've had experience with those sinks since I was a child, and the reading made the case that it really wasn't good design at all. It really is counterintuitive to dirty your hands to empty a sink. This must show how important it is to see past your own preconceptions about what is and isn't obvious. 

*What I learned:* This text was very informative. As with all things design I guess everyone has some intuitive knowledge of these things, but giving them terms like affordance and signifier and feedback demonstrates how things are made the way they are deliberately even when we don't feel it. I'd never considered that affordances and signifiers can disagree. This seems very important. A device that doesn't work in the way the user really thinks it would is so frustrating. I was aware that light switch arrangement should spatially match the lights in the room, but I'd also never considered that mapping and conceptualisation is a means of coping with the abstraction of electronics. Or that the design of an object can actively steer you away from some action (anti-affordance). 

*What I would like to know more about:* It would be interesting to know how certain accepted conceptualisations came about. Some, as the text acknowledges, are natural. But others weren't intuitive at some point and now are, especially the conventions of webdesign and OS's and such. 

*How this relates to the project I am working on:* The basic design principles outlined in this reading are integral to any project. I need to keep in mind what affordances my project has, and which ones it suggests with signifiers; what do I want people to do and what will people inevitably try to do, how I will feedback when they're doing it right and wrong. 

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

*What I thought before:* Many of the things I would've called features are called microinteractions here, like converting currencies or units of measurement. For things that I accepted as microinteractions, I didn't recognise their importance, "your product is as good as the smallest part" is the claim made by the text. I'm not sure I entirely agree in every case but I like the sentiment. I don't think a silent switch that gives poor feedback ruins the iPhone, but I guess the minimalism echoes through the whole product and causes the same problems at times. But a video player with an unreliable volume control I'm going to steer away from. I think the text understands that the impact of any one microinteraction is less and less the more features there are. 

*What I learned:* I never considered that microinteractions are the "feel" of the product and it makes total sense. When I think about the products I most love among many (competative market) it really is the details. Many microinteractions I understand now I take for granted, like scrolling pixel by pixel down my screen. 
This reading also touches on the disconnect between electronics and what we use to control them, and that inferfaces are a method to cope with this disconnect.
I never knew the rule behind apples silent switch, although I ran into the same assumption as in the last reading. Because I grew up with something it feels intuitive and I need to see past my own preconceptions. The accessibility of the silent switch never occured to me. Being one of 5 physical inputs, it's really as accessible as it can be.  

*What I would like to know more about:* I was interesting to learn that microinteractions can be signatures of a product. I'm interested to find more examples of this. I imagine it is a difficult balance preserving signatures and implementing the best microinteraction for the job. 

*How this relates to the project I am working on:* The replication project will necessarily have microinteractions. The text recommends you identify all possible microinteractions in you product and refine them all to the best of your ability. I am now more aware of the details and how they come to represent the whole. I'll be keeping this in mind when it comes to finalising the project. 

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

*What I thought before:* I somewhat denied that people come to expect technological (phones, web) functionality from their physical world. I viewed my devices as a dedicated space for "knowledge and control" and the greater world as a seperate thing, but the text argues otherwise and I don't see why this wouldn't be true, even for me. 

*What I learned:* The reading demonstrated to me how someone with limited experience of programming and electronics could patchwork together a working prototype of quite an intelligent tool from example code and other publically available tools. 
The text reminded me how, as with anything but especially making a product from scratch, there are always unforseen techincal issues, ie: fluactuating light levels setting off camera. The author tried many different methods after finding they weren't working. It's important not to cling onto methods and explore others, but also revisitng earlier methods. The author returned to the first sensor he worked with. The issues can sometimes be non-technical, such as the rather funny but definitely an issue of bomb anxiety surrounding these devices under tables, or cameras used non-invasively still have the potential and therefore the suspicion from customers. 

*What I would like to know more about:* I'd like to find a good repository of example code that would've assisted me on this project. But perhaps my issues were too niche.  

*How this relates to the project I am working on:* This text is motivating a person like me who has little programming and electronics experience to perservere, because, paraphrasing, "it feels like a punch in the face, but a punch in the face you realise isn't so bad and now you're not afraid of it". I always enjoy reading the logs behind someone's work. I should keep structure in mind when inserting my log.

### Timing Gates Improved ###

### Project description ###

The timing gate track measures the velocity of a small object passing through two gates on the track, such as a toy car. It can be used to demonstrate concepts of physics. It can also be used to compare the speeds of different toy cars. On a larger scale, it could become a competative game, timing the speeds of mutiple objects.

### Reflection ###

I felt happy that I could improve the gates at all even if they didn't work in the final. It is a poor sensor to begin with, as the guide admits itself. My car could pass the gates at much faster speeds and still trigger them, and it didn't need the weight of a hand (moved on its own). I also improved the functionality of the gates by making it so they can be used in any order, I believe this is the best addition. Although not being able to control the decimal places is a downfall. 
The failure of the sensors in the last iteration is not an unfortunate coincidence. The method I used was very unreliable to begin with, and perhaps I should've used a different sensor afterall.


This is reflected in the lack of sources for my particular issues. There is no reason to make what is virtually a pressure plate out of alumnium foil when there are very reliable pressure plates out there. The alumnium foil pressure plate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6RXu0pYUVI did not scale down, with small surface area and weight to work with. For anyone wanting to make a reliable measuring tool, using this sensor is an obvious wrong choice. I decided to challenge myself, and in some ways this was the instruction. I did not apply the lesson I learned from Scott Sullivans reading of moving on from broken methods. 


The Kitronik protective case was a good choice. The microbit sits very tightly in the carboard. 

Consulting various forums did not solve my decimal place issue. It did help with the units measured issue. 

The biggest impact on the project were the opinions of the engineers I know who suggested I use the pressure plate method. It was very reassuring at the time, but caused trouble later. Cleaning the oxidation was also something that came up with in conversation. 

I was at a loss of how to find relevant sources for this particular problem. I'm not sure if these are available, or whether I just don't know how to search for themm. 

This project would be interesting on a larger scale as a loop track with remote controlled cars. This would require better sensors and multiple gates (access to the smaller pins would be necessary).
